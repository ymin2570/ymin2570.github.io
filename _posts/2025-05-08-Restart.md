Since 2023, I completed a two-year master's program at Korea University in South Korea, and now I'm planning to start blogging again. After earning my master's degree, I am currently preparing to pursue a PhD in the United States. To improve my English skills, I've decided to write my blog posts in English instead of Korean, as I used to.

Going forward, most of the content will focus on my study abroad preparation process, English language studies, and study notes related to keeping up with the latest research trends. 

I'm currently studying for the TOEFL, so I'm not sure how consistently I'll be able to update the blog, but I'll try my best to keep a record of what I've been studying.

Thank you again to everyone who visits and reads my blog's posts. I appreciate your interest.
